            The university’s decision to dismiss Mr. Davlatov under the webster.uz Student Code of Conduct — without properly incorporating that document into the contract or ensuring the student’s informed consent — raises serious questions of contractual validity and procedural fairness.

            While it is possible that the university may argue the Student Code of Conduct falls under the broadly stated “internal regulations of the center,” the absence of any explicit reference to the SCC in the contract undermines that position.

This procedural inconsistency is outlined in detail below and highlights a lack of adherence not only to contractual obligations but also to basic principles of fairness and due process.

            Nearly a month of complete silence from the administration followed the alleged incident, raising serious concerns about due process and transparency, Mr. Mansur Davlatov was only partially informed of a meeting that would later be used as justification for his dismissal. 
            On February 26th, while on campus for a meeting with the Student Affairs Coordinator—arranged at his own initiative—Mr. 
            Davlatov voluntarily spoke with the Senior Site Registrar, Mr. Ruban, who stated, “We actually wanted to meet with you — come on Friday at 3PM.”

            No official communication was sent before this exchange. Then, on the day of the meeting, Mr. Davlatov received a vague SMS notification just two hours prior, with no formal email, agenda, or clear identification of participants or purpose
            and it was sent through the personal phone number of Senior Site Registrar & Supervisor.
            The meeting in question was supposedly described as being with a so-called “Global GDPR Team”—a claim that is highly likely to be fabricated or false. 
            The decision to withhold any details about the nature of the meeting or the identities of the participants in the SMS notification further supports this conclusion. This lack of transparency, particularly in such a serious matter, raises serious doubts about the legitimacy of the claim. Additional evidence presented later in this article further substantiates these concerns.

  Raises serious concerns regarding transparency and procedural fairness, appearing to be a deliberate effort to prevent the student from preparing an adequate defense. At no point was the meeting described or framed as a formal hearing, and it was repeatedly referred to simply as a “meeting.” 
  The nature of this meeting further demonstrated its one-sided character — it primarily consisted of the university asking Mr. Davlatov questions to gather more information, rather than providing a platform for him to present his case or defend himself.
  No agenda, participant list, or procedural guidelines were shared in advance, and no outcome documentation or recording has ever been provided.

  If Mansur Davlatov had not independently reached out to the Senior Site Registrar on February 26, he would not have been informed about the disciplinary meeting at all. 
  The informal SMS notification was only sent on February 28, which clearly indicates that the meeting would not have been communicated to him otherwise. 
  This delay constitutes a deliberate obstruction of communication.

  Furthermore, both the Webster University Tashkent Student Code of Conduct and the Webster University USA policies explicitly state that students must be given at least three business days to prepare for a disciplinary hearing, to ensure a fair and equitable process. 
  The failure to meet this requirement appears to be highly likely intentional, constituting a clear breach of institutional policy and representing serious procedural mistreatment. 
  This further undermines the integrity and fairness of the disciplinary process. 
This clearly shows the university actively tried to conceal information, strongly suggesting that the so-called ‘Global GDPR Team’ was a misleading or fabricated claim, which was later used to obfuscate the situation under the guise of GDPR violations as a basis for dismissal.         
Additionally, Mr. Davlatov was not provided with any evidence that was claimed to exist during the meeting.
The failure to provide Mr. Davlatov with any evidence that was purportedly discussed during the meeting constitutes a violation of his fundamental right to access evidence.

According to standard academic protocols and due process norms—particularly those outlined in Webster University’s official U.S. policies—students must be provided with clear instructions on how to challenge or appeal disciplinary decisions. 
The omission of such instructions in the official dismissal letter constitutes a serious procedural failure. 
Given that appeal guidelines are routinely included in such correspondence, their absence here—combined with the fact that Mansur Davlatov’s email to the Senior Site Registrar and Dr. Anthony Jarvis expressing his intent to appeal was left unanswered for over three weeks, as detailed in the 'Obstructed Communication and Deliberate Isolation' section—strongly indicates that this was not an oversight, but a deliberate attempt to obstruct his right to appeal.          `,

Following the issuance of an interim suspension, Mansur Davlatov was immediately disconnected from all university-related platforms, including his Canvas account and Webster University email. 
This action was taken under the pretext of interim measures, as outlined in the Webster University Tashkent Student Code of Conduct.
However, despite this suspension being interim in nature, the university failed to provide any alternative channels for communication, in direct contradiction to the Code of Conduct, which clearly states that “alternative forms of communication must be provided.” 
As a result, Mr. Davlatov was forced to physically visit the university on five separate occasions over a four- to five-week period. On two of those visits, he was denied entry by campus security due to his suspension status. 
On the remaining three occasions, he was allowed entry. These repeated visits were made necessary only because the university ignored its obligation to maintain communication and repeatedly failed to respond to Mr. Davlatov’s emails—almost all of which were intentionally left unanswered.


No response was ever issued, and no alternative method for engagement or correspondence was offered. 
The university’s failure to facilitate communication during a critical disciplinary period represents a clear breach of procedural fairness and strongly suggests intentional obstruction.

            While Mr. Mansur Davlatov was actively pursuing legal action against Webster University Tashkent, his legal counsel requested contact with the university’s legal representative to clarify several procedural and legal concerns related to his dismissal. 
            Following this, Mr. Davlatov visited the university in person and made a formal request through the front desk receptionist. 
            As the legal representative was unavailable at that time, the receptionist took down Mr. Davlatov’s name and phone number, assuring him that his request would be forwarded and he would be contacted shortly.
            In the following days, having received no response, Mr. Davlatov personally followed up with the receptionist by phone. 
            She confirmed that both Dr. Anthony Jarvis and the university's legal representative had been informed of the request.

The delivery of the dismissal document came as a severe emotional blow to Mr. Davlatov. He was shocked to discover that the letter had been finalized, signed, and stamped on March 14 — nearly two weeks before it was actually provided to him. During that time, he had been left under the false impression that his case was still under review. This discrepancy not only deepened his distress but also pointed to a serious breakdown in transparent communication.

Just one day before receiving the dismissal letter, the Senior Site Registrar had informed Mr. Davlatov that he was merely on academic break and could return to his studies if he wished. Trusting that information, Mr. Davlatov visited the university in person the next day — only to be handed a dismissal letter that had been issued two weeks prior.

This abrupt reversal and the apparent withholding of critical information left Mr. Davlatov feeling misled and emotionally manipulated. He described the experience as being treated not as a student entitled to fairness and dignity, but as a passive figure in a predetermined process — “played like a doll” by an administration that had already made its decision in secret.

            In a subsequent attempt, when Mr. Davlatov requested a joint meeting with the Senior Site Registrar, he was again denied, this time being told that the Rector was “too busy” and that even the Senior Site Registrar himself was waiting for the Rector’s availability. 
            These repeated deferrals created a sense of intentional inaccessibility at the highest administrative level, leaving Mr. Davlatov with no clear path for recourse or resolution.

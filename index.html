Mr. Mansur Davlatov, a senior student at Webster University’s Tashkent campus, was dismissed from the university under circumstances that raise serious legal and ethical concerns. The case, as presented on this website, outlines a pattern of administrative misconduct, due process violations, and breach of academic contract — all of which were executed without transparency or accountability.

The following day, Mr. Davlatov attended a scheduled meeting with the GCP (Global Citizenship Program) Lead, where he openly discussed a situation involving an alleged academic misconduct.

  Raises serious concerns regarding transparency and procedural fairness, appearing to be a deliberate effort to prevent the student from preparing an adequate defense. At no point was the meeting described or framed as a formal hearing, and it was repeatedly referred to simply as a “meeting.” 
  The nature of this meeting further demonstrated its one-sided character — it primarily consisted of the university asking Mr. Davlatov questions to gather more information, rather than providing a platform for him to present his case or defend himself.
  No agenda, participant list, or procedural guidelines were shared in advance, and no outcome documentation or recording has ever been provided.

  If Mansur Davlatov had not independently reached out to the Senior Site Registrar on February 26, he would not have been informed about the disciplinary meeting at all. 
  The informal SMS notification was only sent on February 28, which clearly indicates that the meeting would not have been communicated to him otherwise. 
  This delay constitutes a deliberate obstruction of communication.

  Furthermore, both the Webster University Tashkent Student Code of Conduct and the Webster University USA policies explicitly state that students must be given at least three business days to prepare for a disciplinary hearing, to ensure a fair and equitable process. 
  The failure to meet this requirement appears to be highly likely intentional, constituting a clear breach of institutional policy and representing serious procedural mistreatment. 
  This further undermines the integrity and fairness of the disciplinary process.

According to standard academic protocols and due process norms—particularly those outlined in Webster University’s official U.S. policies—students must be provided with clear instructions on how to challenge or appeal disciplinary decisions. 
The omission of such instructions in the official dismissal letter constitutes a serious procedural failure. 
Given that appeal guidelines are routinely included in such correspondence, their absence here—combined with the fact that Mansur Davlatov’s email to the Senior Site Registrar and Dr. Anthony Jarvis expressing his intent to appeal was left unanswered for over three weeks, as detailed in the 'Obstructed Communication and Deliberate Isolation' section—strongly indicates that this was not an oversight, but a deliberate attempt to obstruct his right to appeal.          `,

            This inclusion may reflect an attempt to retroactively frame the dismissal in the context of European data protection laws,

Following the issuance of an interim suspension, Mansur Davlatov was immediately disconnected from all university-related platforms, including his Canvas account and Webster University email. 
This action was taken under the pretext of interim measures, as outlined in the Webster University Tashkent Student Code of Conduct.
However, despite this suspension being interim in nature, the university failed to provide any alternative channels for communication, in direct contradiction to the Code of Conduct, which clearly states that “alternative forms of communication must be provided.” 
As a result, Mr. Davlatov was forced to physically visit the university on five separate occasions over a four- to five-week period. On two of those visits, he was denied entry by campus security due to his suspension status. 
On the remaining three occasions, he was allowed entry. These repeated visits were made necessary only because the university ignored its obligation to maintain communication and repeatedly failed to respond to Mr. Davlatov’s emails—almost all of which were intentionally left unanswered.


No response was ever issued, and no alternative method for engagement or correspondence was offered. 
The university’s failure to facilitate communication during a critical disciplinary period represents a clear breach of procedural fairness and strongly suggests intentional obstruction.

            While Mr. Mansur Davlatov was actively pursuing legal action against Webster University Tashkent, his legal counsel requested contact with the university’s legal representative to clarify several procedural and legal concerns related to his dismissal. 
            Following this, Mr. Davlatov visited the university in person and made a formal request through the front desk receptionist. 
            As the legal representative was unavailable at that time, the receptionist took down Mr. Davlatov’s name and phone number, assuring him that his request would be forwarded and he would be contacted shortly.
            In the following days, having received no response, Mr. Davlatov personally followed up with the receptionist by phone. 
            She confirmed that both Dr. Anthony Jarvis and the university's legal representative had been informed of the request. 
            Nevertheless, no contact was initiated by the university.

      In addition, between April 13th and 18th, Mr. Davlatov made two further attempts to schedule a meeting with Dr. Jarvis via the Webster Tashkent call center.
      These efforts were also ignored. 
      The complete lack of acknowledgment over a sustained period — especially while legal action was being pursued — raises serious questions about the institution’s willingness to engage in good faith and its compliance with the principles of transparency, due process, and procedural fairness.

The delivery of the dismissal document came as a severe emotional blow to Mr. Davlatov. He was shocked to discover that the letter had been finalized, signed, and stamped on March 14 — nearly two weeks before it was actually provided to him. During that time, he had been left under the false impression that his case was still under review. This discrepancy not only deepened his distress but also pointed to a serious breakdown in transparent communication.

Just one day before receiving the dismissal letter, the Senior Site Registrar had informed Mr. Davlatov that he was merely on academic break and could return to his studies if he wished. Trusting that information, Mr. Davlatov visited the university in person the next day — only to be handed a dismissal letter that had been issued two weeks prior.

This abrupt reversal and the apparent withholding of critical information left Mr. Davlatov feeling misled and emotionally manipulated. He described the experience as being treated not as a student entitled to fairness and dignity, but as a passive figure in a predetermined process — “played like a doll” by an administration that had already made its decision in secret.

            In a subsequent attempt, when Mr. Davlatov requested a joint meeting with the Senior Site Registrar, he was again denied, this time being told that the Rector was “too busy” and that even the Senior Site Registrar himself was waiting for the Rector’s availability. 
            These repeated deferrals created a sense of intentional inaccessibility at the highest administrative level, leaving Mr. Davlatov with no clear path for recourse or resolution.

They point to a deliberate pattern of obstruction, potentially reflecting an internal directive or informal decision not to engage with Mr. Davlatov’s correspondence during a critical period.

    This vague and unverified citation of a “GDPR document” raises serious concerns about the legitimacy of the dismissal process. 
    There was no attempt to formally provide or describe the document, no written copy was shared, and the nature of the alleged “GDPR team” involved remains unknown to this day.
